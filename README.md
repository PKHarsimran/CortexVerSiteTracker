## How It Works

1. **Setting the Target URL**
   - The script is configured to monitor a specific URL. Originally designed for Cortex agent version updates, it can be easily adjusted to track any website.

2. **Fetching Website Content**
   - At regular intervals, the script sends an HTTP request to the targeted URL to fetch the current content of the webpage.

3. **Computing the Content Hash**
   - The script computes a hash (SHA-256) of the fetched content. This hash serves as a fingerprint of the content at that specific time.

4. **Detecting Changes**
   - The current hash is compared with the previously stored hash (from the last check). If there's a difference, it indicates that the content of the webpage has changed.

5. **Logging and Alerts**
   - Upon detecting a change, the script logs this information and can be configured to send alerts or notifications, keeping the user informed about the updates.

6. **Docker Integration**
   - The script is containerized using Docker. This ensures that it runs in an isolated environment, with consistent settings, regardless of where it is deployed.
   - Inside the Docker container, the script is executed periodically as a cron job, automating the monitoring process.

7. **Resource Efficiency**
   - The script is designed to be light on system resources, making it an efficient solution for continuous monitoring.

## Usage

- To use the script, simply configure the target URL in the script settings.
- Deploy the script using Docker to ensure a consistent and isolated environment.
- The script will regularly check the specified website and notify you of any changes detected.
