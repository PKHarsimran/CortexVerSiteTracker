| Create a Python script to track website changes | In progress   | Develop a Python script that can retrieve and store the hash of a website. Add functionality to compare the stored hash with the current website hash to detect changes.                     | Using `requests` and `hashlib` modules.           |
| Implement a function to save website hashes     | Completed     | Create the `save_hash()` function capable of saving website hashes to a file named `hash.txt`.                                                                                                          | Accepts website URL and hash as input.            |
| Establish a continuous website monitoring loop  | In progress   | Design a loop that continuously checks the website for changes. When a discrepancy between the current hash and the stored hash is detected, the script will trigger a change notification. | Uses a `while True` loop for continuous monitoring. |
| Notify of website changes via Jira             | To be done    | Integrate Jira for change notifications. Develop code to automatically create Jira tickets or updates when website changes are detected.                                                              | Specify Jira project and issue details.           |

| Implement error handling for HTTP requests      | Completed     | Added error handling to HTTP requests to handle network errors gracefully and log them for debugging purposes.                                                                                            | Using `requests.exceptions.RequestException`.        |
| Implement error handling for file writing       | Completed     | Added error handling when saving the hash to a file to handle potential file-related issues and log errors.                                                                                                 | Using Python exception handling.                     |
| Configure logging for better diagnostics       | Completed     | Set up logging to log status messages and errors to a file (`website_monitor.log`) for better diagnostics and debugging.                                                                                  | Using `logging.basicConfig()`.                        |
| Modularize the code                            | Completed     | Modularized the code into functions to improve code organization and readability.                                                                                                                          | Functions include `get_hash`, `save_hash`, and `check_website_for_changes`.                                      |
| Define constants for configuration              | Completed     | Defined constants at the beginning of the script to allow for easy configuration changes and to enhance script flexibility.                                                                               | Constants include `URL`, `FILENAME`, and `SLEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.                                               |
| Log script start and stop                      | Completed     | Added logging messages to indicate when the website monitoring script starts and stops, providing better visibility into script execution.                                                                 | Using `logging.info()`.                              |
