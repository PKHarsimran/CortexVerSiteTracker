## How It Works

### 1. **Target URL Configuration**
   - Users configure the script to monitor a specific URL. This flexibility allows tracking of virtually any website.

### 2. **Fetching and Analyzing Content**
   - The script periodically sends an HTTP request to the targeted URL to fetch the current webpage content.
   - It computes a SHA-256 hash of this content, providing a unique fingerprint for the current state of the webpage.

### 3. **Change Detection Mechanism**
   - The script compares the newly computed hash with a previously stored hash (from the last check).
   - A difference in hashes indicates a change in the webpage content.

### 4. **Notifications and Logging**
   - When a change is detected, the script logs this event.
   - It can be configured to send notifications or alerts to inform users about these changes.

## Advanced Features

### Cron Job Scheduling
- The script is integrated with a cron job within a Docker container. This setup automates the process, with the script running at regular intervals defined in the cron schedule.

### Docker Integration
- **Dockerfile Creation:** A Dockerfile is created to define the script's running environment. This file includes instructions for setting up Python, installing necessary dependencies, and configuring the cron job.
- **Isolated Environment:** Running the script inside a Docker container ensures an isolated and consistent environment, regardless of the deployment platform.
- **Cron Setup in Docker:** The Dockerfile includes steps to set up a cron job that regularly triggers the script. This approach automates the monitoring process, making it more reliable and efficient.

## Usage

- **Configure the URL:** Set the target website URL in the script.
- **Deploy with Docker:** Build the Docker container using the provided Dockerfile. This container includes everything needed to run the script.
- **Automated Monitoring:** Once deployed, the script will automatically check the specified website at intervals defined in the cron job.
